# Lexical Normalization

Social media provides a rich source of information. It is notoriously noisy but also interesting because of its fast
pace, informal nature, and the vast amount of available data.
The creative language use found on social media introduces many difficulties for existing natural language
processing tools.
One way to overcome these issues is to "normalize" this data to a more canonical register before processing it.
In this task, we focus on lexical normalization, which involves making replacements at the word level.
